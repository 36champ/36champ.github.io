                    Bowyer-Watson algorithm is an algorithm to create the Delaunay triangulation from the
                    finite amount of source points regardless to the number of dimensions. This section aims
                    to explain the main idea of how the algorithm works.
                    <div class="text-bold">Delaunay Triangulation</div>
                    In \(2D\), Delaunay triangulation refers to a way to connects each source point in the way
                    that all regions are triangles and no circumcircle of any triangle contains more than \(3\)
                    source points.
                    <div class="text-bold">Starting from \(2D\)</div>
                    The algorithm starts off by defining a super-triangle that's big enough to contains all
                    source points. Then, for each source point we remove all triangles that their circumcircles
                    contain a newly added source point. We then will have a hole that isn't triangulated and
                    we can triangulate it by using a newly added point. After that, we delete all triangles
                    that contains a vertex from the super-triangle.
                    High-dimensional integration with Voronoi Piecewise Surrogates
                    <div class="text-bold">Higher Dimension</div>
                    In a higher dimension, a triangle is not just a triangle any more. For example, in \(3D\), a
                    triangle becomes a tetrahedron. In \(d\) dimensions, a triangle will have \(d + 1\) vertices.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Finding the circumcenter of a triangle can be solved using linear algebra.</li>
                        <li>When patching a hole, you will already have d points in the edges of the hole, justadd the source point in.</li>

                    <div class="text-24px text-bold text-center">How to estimate the area of each Voronoi cell without finding its exact shape</div>
                    <div class="text-bold">Proposed Algorithm</div>
                    Let's define the problem first. Given a set of \(n\) points from \([0, 1]^d\), what is the area of
                    each Voronoi cell centered at each point in the set?<br>
                    By definition, Voronoi diagram of a set of \(n\) source points partitions the domain
                    space into \(n\) regions (which is called cell) such that each point is the region is closer to
                    the source of the region than any other sources.<br>
                    High-dimensional integration with Voronoi Piecewise Surrogates
                    After knowing the definition, how could one exploit this fact to quickly estimate the
                    area of each Voronoi cells.<br>
                    Using Monte Carlo method, we first take \(k\) samples from our domain. For each point
                    that we sampled, we can quickly find which source point is closet to our sampled point,
                    and then, we add \(1/k\) to the area of that Voronoi cell.
                    <div class="text-bold">Pros</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very fast, since we don't need to compute the Voronoi diagram.</li>
                        <li>The sum of areas is guaranteed to be \(1\).</li>
                        <li>Doesn't need to sample more points as the number of dimensions grows.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="text-bold">Cons</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is just the estimation of the area.</li>
                        <li>Voronoi cells may have zero areas.</li>
